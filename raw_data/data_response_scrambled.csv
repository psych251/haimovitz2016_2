"1",1,"At first I would sympathize because the child would be upset. Then I would discuss how much effort was actually put into the studying process. Then perhaps we would strategize to have better study habits for certain classes.","Initially my gut reaction would be disappointment. But I would not say that.","As a parent I would understand that something went wrong between studying for the test and taking the test. Clearly the child didn't study enough or ask enough questions for things that they didn't understand. My gut reaction would be to be disappointed, but then I would take a step back and analyze how the grade was arrived at and what was lacking in the studying habits of the child."
"2",2,"I'd say ""What happened? I thought you studied"" I'd want to get to the bottom of why they did so poorly.","I'd think that either they didn't study enough or their study habits weren't effective.","I'd feel disappointed, to be honest."
"3",3,"sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you learn when you get things right so get your head down and make sure you try your hardest and that you give your studies everything and if you give it a go next time may be better. i can help you practise and we can read practise questions so that at the next test hopefully you will do better","i think that everyone can have an off day and so i would help my child practise so next time they will be better prepared","i would give my child all the support i can to try and reverse this with my child for the next time"
"4",4,"I would ask my child if they tried their best and that if they did and they know that they did then they have nothing to be upset about and that they can try harder next time.","I would think that they need a little more practice because they didn't understand the material completely.","I would feel bad because my child felt badly about themselves and I would want to try and help them in the best way I could so that they know that sometimes we mess up on things but you can always try and fix the problem or work on the problem and do better in the future."
"5",5,"I would ask what happened, and say that I thought she knew the material.","What the heck happened?","Frustrated and disappointed"
"6",6,"I thought you felt the test went well? What do you think happened? Let's review what you got wrong and make sure you understand what you did wrong, so next time you know how to solve the problems. It's okay, it's not the end of the world. You will have to study a bit more harder next time.","That there is obviously some math concept that he doesn't fully get. Maybe multiple concepts.","Disappointed and I would feel bad that my child thought it went well and it didn't and that he must be feeling pretty bad and disappointed as well."
"7",7,"Oh wow, what happened? Were there questions ya'll didn't cover on there? I'd look through the test and we would go over the material.","I would think the test was printed incorrectly or their was major miscommunication in the class","I would feel frustrated but I know that the test is just a test"
"8",8,"Don't worry son, you gave your best effort. In the next exam you recover and we can study together if you want. Take it easy, everything has a solution in this life","That he really tried hard to get good grades, but I'm not going to scold him for that, on the contrary I will help him as much as I can.","I would feel sad because he feels sad, however I would give him my support so that he can overcome this situation and feel more calm."
"9",9,"I'm sure this is disappointing, but you can use this as a learning tool.  Which questions did you miss, and how would you come to the correct answer?  And just remember, this is only one test, a snapshot in time.  Education is all about ongoing learning.  No one is perfect, and we love you.","I would feel badly for my child because I know she feels terrible about the test.","I would want to talk to the teacher to see how we could help our child to reach their full potential without causing too much stress."
"10",10,"Thats a pity, it seems you mustve misunderstood the tasks, lets lokat them and see if we can find the confusion","teacher has let child down","sad that child feels they have failed"
"11",11,"Ok, don't worry, sometimes it happens. You think you know something but for some reason everything goes bad. Now we sit together with the book and we see what could have happened.","Sometimes when you feel too secure it's easy to fall into mistake. Maybe she read too fast and misunderstood.","Not a big deal, it's a part of the learning process."
"12",12,"you can always study more to get a higher grade","that the child needs a little help on the matter","normal"
"13",13,"What happened in the exam? Did you not comprehend the topic in hand?","The child is not having a hard time comprehending the topic","Confused on why that happened"
"14",14,"I would reassure him that everything will be ok. We will go over the material and see where things went wrong.","I would feel bad and try to get to the bottom of this. I would want to see what was so confusing","I would badly for my son as math is his favorite subject. As a parent I will help him succeed"
"15",15,"Probably say that they did their best, but that they should probably work a bit harder to get a better grade.","That it will be fine if he/she improves","A little bit dissapointed"
"16",16,"Encourage them that it's a new class and they will get better with time as long as they keep trying their best.","Slightly concerned they thought it went okay, but got an F. Would tell myself it's a new class and keep an eye on it.","Concerned, but not overly worried."
"17",17,"I would say that now they know that they need to pay more attention to their studies and that they will have the entire year to bring their grade up to where they think it should be.","I would think that they have found a level where their natural intelligence has plateaued and that they now need to work harder.","It wouldn't bother me if this was only the first exam as they still have time to make corrections and learn the material."
"18",18,"I would tell my child that they thought they were prepared for the test but it was possible that they weren't. Then maybe we should hire a tutor, or they should seek their teacher for extra guidance. I would explain that being overconfident can sometimes be a downfall.","I would think that they or trying hard, but they may have overestimated their abilities.","I would feel as if my child had made a mistake. That they would have thought that it was easier than it should be. That sometimes life presents you with challenges that you need to overcome."
"19",19,"We would sit down and discuss the areas that he failed on and look at ways to improve these areas, we would set in place a plan to improve on the areas he did not do so well on and put in extra work to improve. We would encourage our boy to learn by these mistakes by setting additional home tests.","We all have to learn somewhere and mistakes are common and not to be scared of - but to improve is first to look at what went wrong so he can address those issues and improve his learning abilities in those particular areas.","I would not be to hard on him and explain everyone makes mistakes and we can't all get everything right and that I am not upset that his mark is a fail because from this point on we can address the issues together and move forward. I think as a parent you need to point out the positives and not be to disappointed about the failures as these can be addressed so to take a positive approach and deliver a solution encourages the child to learn."
"20",20,"Find out from the teacher where you went wrong and do some Homework on that side of the Math.","I would be surprised but would look at it constructively.","More concerned about rebuilding the child's focus and knowledge of the Math."
"21",21,"I would say that we can always get better and lets go over the work again together.","That my child did not have a good enough understanding of the subject.","A bit disappointed but thats life"
"22",22,"We can study more for the next test. It's only the start.","Have my child review their notes nightly.","Frustrated but hopeful."
"23",23,"I would ask if they understand what they got wrong and would look it over with them to improve for next time.","I would be concerned that they didn't have understanding of math.","I would feel worried and like something is wrong."
"24",24,"OK did you answer all the questions? Did you show your work?","Not sure depending on my child's perceived  ability","Bad for them"
"25",25,"I would tell her not to worry that we can get her extra help so that she understands the material better.","I would think that she wasn't studying effectively and needs extra help to understand the concepts.","I would be concerned that my child remains optimistic that she can learn the material and not feel defeated."
"26",26,"It's okey, small mistake, but you will keep up in the future","It's okey, nothing bad happend","Nothing new"
"27",27,"Sorry to hear about that, it must be disappointing for you. I know you like maths so we'll just keep on with it. You'll do better in the tests when you learn some more. It's no big deal.","The subject material is more difficult than she thinks.","I don't like to see her upset but ups and downs in life are normal and usually beneficial."
"28",28,"I would be surprised due to the fact that s/he was studying for it. Therefore, I will ask my child to think about what possibly went wrong. I will then ask her teacher about what s/he thinks went wrong and work from there.","I think that my child either studied but did not understand it well, or they haven't studied and lied which in reality I feel they won't lie to me.","I would feel OK, nothing major that will make me that I failed my child or that my child isn't intelligent and give up on them."
"29",29,"I would be asking my child what happened? and then have the child talk about the test, how they felt while taking it, how others did on the test, etc. Then, I would sit with the child and go over the test and see if we could figure out what the correct answers should be. If we are unable to figure out the answers, I would schedule a conference with the math teacher.","I would be concerned that my child is not grasping the material.","I would be very concerned and want to help my child as much as possible."
"30",30,"Honey, I'm so sorry.  Let's take a look at the problems on your test together.  I'm proud of you trying your best and working hard on all the problems you knew how to do.","I would be shocked and would want to investigate further to see if there were mistakes made on the grading of the test.","I would feel regret that I hadn't spent time helping my child prep in advance of the test."
"31",31,"It's OK. These grades aren't that important in the long run but it tells us that you need more practice. Don't be afraid to ask the teacher for help and we can work harder on the problems at home.","The same as I said. I would be worried about their self esteem though.","I would feel like maybe I didn't help them prepare enough. I would feel happy to help."
"32",32,"It looks like yoy failed your math test today. You studied for it for a good bit of time so what happened? It doesn't make sense that you only got a 54.","I would think that my child had not really studied for the test. It would be my assumption that they lied about studying their math.","I would feel disappointed and would want answers as to how this happened. If my child really did study and failed then we may need to look into getting a tutor. If my child lied and did not study then he would need to have devices taken away."
"33",33,"It's perfectly fine - you've just started, you must have misunderstood some things. We'll figure out what was wrong, work on those mistakes, and you will do great the next time. I will help you.","Poor kid, she must be devastated.","Sad for my girl"
"34",34,"Its okay! we will see where our problem areas are and will work on them.","I think the situation is relatable and is not a big issue because there's nothing that we cant work on.","I would feel like helping my child in gaining the knowledge required to pass her exam."
"35",35,"i'll sit with her to see together what went wrong in the test and  what she did not understand","she overstimate her comprehension of the subject","interested and a little stressed"
"36",36,"I would ask her what went wrong since she told me she was confident she would get good grades.","It could probably not be her fault. Maybe her teacher didn't explain well enough, or she just didn't get the information as she should, or got nervous by the time she was having her test.","I would feel worried about her."
"37",37,"I would ask them what happened. I would also see if the test could be retaken or if additional points could be earned. I would also ask where they thought things went wrong.","I would be okay as long as my child tried their best","I would feel that maybe they need help and that I missed it."
"38",38,"It is a hard task, we should learn harder to understand things.","Logic is a thing you have or haven't.","Disappointed"
"39",39,"What went wrong - you seem to enjoy that class and knew the work?","Perhaps the exam/assessment pressure made my child forget the work due to  panic","Concerned and wanting to help my child left performance"
"40",40,"I am proud of you for trying your best but lets look at where you went wrong so you can better next time.","I would wonder what went wrong but it's not a big deal as they can learn from it.","I would be unhappy and confused."
"41",41,"Don't worry too much, that can happen. Next time, you'll be better prepared. I will help you study.","I'd think he underestimated the difficulty and maybe didn't manage the time well or was nervous.","Like I need to spend more time helping him out."
"42",42,"I would tell them they tried really hard and I was proud of them. I would say it's only the first test and they may do better later and to keep trying and not get discouraged.","I would be surprised they did not get a better score. I would think maybe they were overconfident. I would wonder about the validity of the test and how others scored.","I would wonder if I could have done more to help them. I wouldn't blame the child, but would look at what more we could do. I would be a little disappointed."
"43",43,"I would tell my son that even though he might think he had studied and prepared the test sufficiently, sometimes it is better not to be so confident and if he can make a little more effort. Don’t let it fall apart. A low score is not the end of the world and can be improved.","Encourage him to continue studying


","I’d feel calm, a bad test is not the end of the world."
"44",44,"What happened here? I thought you said you knew it pretty well? I think we should sit down and go over the questions and your answers to see how we can improve your scores for next time. It is ok to not do well but I want to help you do better next time.","I would remember how hard my dad was on me when I would fail tests even though I had studied really hard for it. I would not want to make him feel that way as well.","I would be sad for him to get such a bad grade but I would feel like I failed as well. I would try to make more time to sit and work with him so that he could do better next time."
"45",45,"It is the first exam, everything is fine, failure is part of the success","That a grade does not define the knowledge of my children, and it is just a casual test","With the duty to motivate and teach my children to learn and not get frustrated"
"46",46,"Let's look at what went wrong","I would wonder if the material covered on the test truly reflected the assignments and lessons.","Sad for my child"
"47",47,"I would tell them not to worry and just to study harder for the next one","I would be disappointed","I would feel bad like I should of helped more"
"48",48,"Everyone fails you have to learn from it and improve on it, that is the only way to get better at anything.","I think she would need to learn more, no point thinking you know everything until you do.","Supportive"
"49",49,"I would ask what they think went wrong, and if they needed help studying in the future.","I would be concerned that the teacher did not make sure the students understood the lessons.","I would feel bad for my child, as long as I thought they really tried, and would want to encourage, rather than discourage him or her."
"50",50,"I will tell him, What happened, you told me you were good at this class?
Will try to review the wrong answers with him, to identify and explain the errors.","I think I need to talk to teacher and verify the teaching methods.","Supportive to my son"
"51",51,"I would ask what type of questions did she feel uncomfortable with and to explain them so I can help her to understand them better. I would ask about some of the other questions she thought were easy and prepare someone others ones for her to complete","That my child enjoys the class but isn't quiet understanding the content. I would also think that the teacher is missing or misinterpretating my child's progression or understanding","I wouldn't feel terrible I would help my daughter understand the math problems to help her do better"
"52",52,"You got more than half of them right","Math I'd hard for me too","Sympathetic"
"53",53,"Let's sit down and look at it together. I would review the problems that s/he got incorrect. Have them correct the problems they got wrong and probably give them a few more similar  problems for practice.","I would help my child understand why they got the problems wrong and determine how they became so confused.","I would feel bad as a parent if the teacher did not have time allotted in their schedules to reteach and retest students."
"54",54,"I would first ask him if there were any questions that he did not understand in his exam and then review with him the questions and his answers and obviously I would punish him if it was his mistake and if not I would simply tell him to study better he cannot make this kind of mistakes in his first year.","very bad","annoyed and somewhat angry."
"55",55,"I would tell her ""That's too bad because I know how hard you worked and how interested you were!  We'll have to go over it and find out where things went wrong""  I would then go over the material with her and help her catch up.","I would think I should help her improve so she can keep up the enthusiasm and not lose heart.","I would feel happy that my child was working hard and curious where the the break down happened."
"56",56,"I would feel terrible for her because I know she would take this very hard.  I would ask her if she thought she tried her best.  Since she likes the teacher I would encourage her to go to the teacher and have a conversation as to why the disparity between how she scored and how she thought she understood the material.","I would think that she didn’t understand the material as much as she thought.","I would feel very frustrated and also sad for my daughter because she is sensitive."
"57",57,"I would tell my child that he needs to be better and that he needs to improve , but i will also ecourage him to practice more math.","i would think that maybe some questions where just to hard for myt child to understand .","i would feel the need to help my child so he can improve."
"58",58,"me gustaria que fueran mas inteligentes y sepan como dese,peñar los ploblemas del dia a dia por so solas","que lo intentaran","mucho mas confiado sobre sus decciones
"
"59",59,"Well sweetie, Im proud of you for trying your best because at the end of the day that is all that matters. I would never be upset with you as long as you did try. You can always improve. Lets maybe try speaking with your teacher to possible give you some better understanding of the material that was confusing for you.","I would think that my child needs more help in math class.","I wouldnt feel disappointed or anything. I dont believe in punishing my child for misunderstanding some things. I just feel that my child can learn from his mistakes and needs to ask for help more often."
"60",60,"I would let my child know that it was okay, and to offer help with the questions that were confusing. I would never give my child a hard time for a low grade, I would just encourage them that they'll do better on the next one. I would let them know that I would hep them in any way that I can.","I would think that maybe there was something my child was solving the question, maybe with a wrong formula, and didn't realize it, along with not understanding some of the questions.","I would not be angry, everyone makes a bad grade at least once in their life, and I would never make my child feel bad for something like that. I feel as if I could offer help to my child to help them better understand the course material."
"61",61,"Encourage them to reach out if needed for help to understand where the confusion came from - why did they think they knew it so well?","I would feel sad that they felt so confident when that was incorrect","Upset for them. Hopeful that since they were enjoying it they will continue to work at it."
"62",62,"Chill, next time you will do better","same what i said - i say what i think","Neutral, everyone was a kid a know how it feels to get bad grade"
"63",63,"I would tell him that math is a difficult subject and that I had trouble with it too growing up.  I would then offer him help from myself and his dad so that he won’t find it as challenging in the future.  I think if we worked with him, we could help him to learn it better.","I’m disappointed he didn’t score higher.  I’d like to work with him myself to see where his problem areas were at and try to help him with them.","I would feel disappointed, but hopeful that we can turn it around in the future."
"64",64,"I’d ask them if they know what happened and encourage them to talk to the teacher if they don’t so they can be better equipped for the next exam","I’d think the teacher might be pushing them","Frustrated for my child"
"65",65,"Why do you think you got this grade? Is there something you could’ve done differently to get a better grade?","They must have miss interpreted the questions or did not complete a section","Like I didn’t do enough to help them study"
"66",66,"It’s okay baby. Let’s see what you missed and use this to learn from.","I’d wonder what happened.","I would feel trrrible."
"67",67,"I would ask my child to please tell me how math class is doing. I need to know what my child understands and I need to speak with the teacher to see what we can do.","I would feel a little anxious and tense I really don't want my child to struggle. I am thinking that I need to help in every way possible.","I would feel a little down on myself as a parent. I would feel like I am doing something wrong. I really want to help  my child."
"68",68,"I would ask my child if they would like to study more or do things differently before the next test.","On one occasion I would not overthink it. I would see if I could learn about how my child handles their performance relative to their expectations.","Sad for my child, ready to see how we can improve"
"69",69,"What happened? I thought you said you did okay! Did you get nervous during the test? There must have been some kind of mistake.","I would try to figure out what happened, to see if it's a problem with my child's learning or if it was a mistake on the teacher or test's part. I would wonder if the teacher was actually teaching adequately for the material that was on the test.","I would feel stressed and anxious, and worried about my child's ability to pass the class, and how it would affect her ability to get into the next grade."
"70",70,"I would be frustrated, so I would take time to myself to calm down. Then I would go over the test w my kid, and first ask if there was anything in particular they liked. Then point out what they did good at. Then, I would ask what they felt was hardest for them. Next, I would go over the test a little at a time with them and focus on struggle areas so we can learn together why it was hard.","I would immediately knee jerk think my kid hadn't tried. Fucked, I know, I'm trying to work past it. Then I would try to figure out if my kid really thought things went okay, or if they felt they had to say that.","I would feel immediately like I had fucked up somehow like I wasn't paying attention enough w my kid to know they were struggling."
"71",71,"I would let them know that it's okay as it is the first test at the beginning of the year.","It isn't the biggest deal. Their average will be able to change as long as they put in the effort. This low mark will allow them to improve in the future by using different studying strategies.","I wouldn't be too upset as it is the first test of the year in a new math class. I would make sure that they know what they're doing in class and figure out what went wrong."
"72",72,"I would tell her that is okay, and let her know she is learning. That is the reason she went to school in the first place to learn new things, challenges, etc learning is a process, not a by-product.","I wouldn't think anything different, because as a parent and fortunately as a teacher I know her result couldn't define her ability.","I might feel determined, make plans to help her, and show her the same support I do every day."
"73",73,"We would talk about how it takes a lot of practice to do things better. I would see if my child is open to me practicing with them and trying to get better.","I would feel disappointed that they dont yet understand the material. I would worry my son wouldnt like math in the future.","I would worry my son wouldnt like math in the future."
"74",74,"I will stay calm and nicely ask him if he studied well and if there was any problem before the exam, will revise with him the material themes to make sure he understands and likes them or not.","I would think perhaps he was stressed out or distracted by other things or probably he likes the material but he's still not good enough at it and needs to do more efforts.","Not worried."
"75",75,"I’d initially feel a little disappointed. I’d ask him if he felt that he studied enough and used his strategies during the test. Id ask if he rushed and when he planned to retake or correct the test. I’d let him know that sometimes we need to do really poorly at something to learn how to do things. Just like on his bike.","I’d be sad for him and want to try to immediately fix things for him.","I would feel like I could have done more to help him study or help him with his homework."
"76",76,"Better don't let youwin by proud, don't undestimate an exam, study more and better luck next time","He was too overtrusted","Maybe i can help him more"
"77",77,"I would motivate him, by saying it isn't the end of the world, maybe the comprehension was a problem, maybe he was stressed, or maybe he wasn't so aware of the material as he tought.
There's more tests in the future and he can definitely do better next time.","As a first test I wouldn't be very preoccupied, I should pay more attention to study method and how deep he knows the materials.","Motivated to understand what went wrong, and help him more."

"80",80,"I would say to him that it's ok to get a low note sometimes but that I will expect him to study more for next exams.","I mean if he likes the subject, the teacher and he also did study a reasonable amount of time, I won't be angry at all, because you can get confused in a test sometimes, it happened to me a couple of times when I had his age.","A little disappointed with myself that I didn't help my son get a better grade, but sometimes it's good to fail to pay attention to mistakes and do better next time."
"81",81,"I would be supportive because I knew they enjoyed the subject and encourage them to not let this get them down and away their opinion of the subject.","I think that testing can often be ineffective on showing ones skill level.","I would feel sad and disappointed for my child who now doesn’t know how to feel about the subject they previously enjoyed."
"82",82,"It's ok. Let's look at the items that you missed and review them.","I would think that I needed to spend more time reviewing the chapter with them.","Fine. I know that my child has a growth mindset and grit."
"83",83,"let’s ask your teacher why you were wrong & how to fix it. ask about tutoring or one on one options","it’s harder than they thought","upset"
"84",84,"
I would say that they are just learning and it takes time to learn new things and to keep trying, and ask for help from the teacher","I would think the same thing that I said","I would feel a little bad but also have confidence that theyll get better with practice"
"85",85,"I'd say maybe they should have studied harder or verified which information was going to be on the test prior.","I would think that they either didn't study hard enough or that the teachers wording on the test was confusing to them.","Disappointed"
"86",86,"Tell her she should study the questions that she got wrong to ensure an understanding of the concepts.","I would think maybe she didn't study enough or ask for help when she didn't understand the subject matter.","I would worry that the F would impact her final grade."
"87",87,"Probably the supportive - aww better luck next time. Just keep studying.","What can I do to help.","Maybe slightly disappointed."
"88",88,"I would look the test over with my child, and see what happened and what mistakes were made, then try to learn from there and move forward.","That as long as my child did their best, I'm proud of them, but I would be confused as to how they thought they did well but ended up with a failing grade.","I would feel bad for my child, more because of how badly they might feel right now, not because of the actual failing grade"
"89",89,"I would ask him if he thinks he gave it his all or if he thinks he could have prepared more. I would let him know I’m not mad and that we will get better together. I would tell him that as long as he’s trying his best to never get discouraged","I would be sad and nervous for his future in that class and for his self esteem","I would be nervous about the future and how we’re going to remedy the situation"
"90",90,"I would sit them down and discuss the score with them and reassure them that they are not a failure and they will only continue to get better, the more they learn.","Immediately following the knowledge of the score, I would internally be a little upset, but I know that no one is perfect and they will comprehend the material after some time.","At first, I might struggle a little and feel as it I'm failing my child, but in reality, no one usually gets a perfect score the first time they are tested on new material."
"91",91,"That it was okay that the F does not determine how well you know math but let’s practice more at home to prepare you for the next test","I would be curious on how truly comfortable my child was in his math class with the material given and if he or she felt comfortable enough to ask questions when needed","I would feel like I should do more at home practice and they today math overview so make sure that my child wasn’t falling behind in class due to not understanding the material being taught in the class"
"92",92,"Wow! Though the result was unexpectedly bad, I need to find out what could have been the actual cause for failure.","I would think positively and advise him/her on how to perform better next time.","A bit disappointed."
"93",93,"Would you like some help?","She may run into some kind of bottle neck.","I will worry about her not being able to catch up and eventually giving up."
"94",94,"Don't worry too much about it. You should focus on math more and also I'll help you out more.","It's not a big deal, I used to fail quite a bit in math myself and know you can turn it aroud with some work.","I need to check out how often my child works on improving and learning math."
"95",95,"I would tell my child to read well so that he can improve later on and he should never be scolded. He will definitely get good results if he explains it nicely.","I think I will explain it to him in a very nice way and tell him to concentrate on his studies.","I feel a little bad but I will feel much better if I improve in the future."
"96",96,"You should put more effort on the subject","She got too excited and didn't focus","A but disappointed"
"97",97,"what went wrong? didn't you study enough? but don't worry there's always next time.","that maybe s/he needs to practice more, and get a tutor to help them.","disappointed and sad."
"98",98,"I would tell her that she really needs to turn her grades around and that if she doesn't understand thr material that I'd be happy to help her.","I would hope it would just be a one off and that with work she would improve.","Not terribly bad at first. But if it continued I'd definitely be concerned."
"99",99,"That its OK to fail, it just mean you need to work harder and reevaluate your position. See what you did wrong and try to become better.Don`t give up, keep working. Only through failure we can learn.","that he may looses motivation and gives up also that maybe he is not very good at the particular subject but he can improve by putting more effort.","worried alert"
"100",100,"613c006415e98728127c6085","I would think that it is necessary to make him more willing to increase the grades and practice more the weak points of his knowledge in mathematics","
I would feel that it is a moment of opportunity"
"101",101,"I would talk with him but with patience, and I would say that it´s okay but he has to improve his skills in math.","I have always thought that an exam doesn´t determine how intelligent you are.","I feel normal because a qualification doesn´t determine my child´s intelligence."
"102",102,"I would tell him not to worry, that he will have more opportunities to show how hard he tries and I would tell him that anything he does not understand, ask me to explain.","That he really cares to show that he studied but that it was not the result he expected","Proud that he studied but sad that it was not the result he expected"
"103",103,"I would try to comfort her and let her know that some people aren't good at taking tests, and struggle even when they know the material.","I would help her study the next time to make sure she's studying efficiently.","I works feel hopeful. There's no sense lecturing or making her feel bad when she tried and has likely already beat herself up enough."
"104",104,"First I will tell my child that he was good and he tried his best and that he must keep up the good things that he did.
secondly, I will tell him to focus more than before and that he must pay attention and read carefully before he answers every question and also to remind him that practice makes perfect.","I will think of some ideas that will improve his curriculum and how can I support him.","I will feel like I have to do something to Help."
"105",105,"I would say it's ok, especially if she had studied. I would also ask what she thought happened and what could she do differently for the next test.","I would think what did she do wrong to do so badly.","I would be upset."
"106",106,"You need to study the the equations more to see if you really know what you think you know and see where you made mistakes","I think that my child needs to make sure they really understand the work and figure out what they did wrong and figure out how to correct it","I would feel empathy for my child knowing they are probably upset for failing"
"107",107,"We would need to talk to the teacher to see what areas my child was weak in/got wrong. Then look for external support to mkae sure my child understood what was required and was able to improve. Discuss study habits and how to improve there as well.","Depends on the grade level and history of maths with the child. If still early enough I would think we have time to improve. If getting close to end of schooling, would worry about remaining time and look to do accelerated tutoring.","Fine, as long as the child is a decent person. Not everyone is good at maths and will have strengths in other areas to focus on."
"108",108,"Why did you get an F?","That they enjoy the class more than the actual lesson","Disappointed"
"109",109,"I would ask what they like about the class and how they are learning. I'd suggest exploring ways to better understand the subject of the method of teaching","Id be concerned the subject was too difficult","Like I failed to teach him good study habits.  ""mom guilt"""
"110",110,"You almost got 60 but why did you think it went ok with a low score like that? Tell me if you need help","I think either he doesnt care so he thinks his answer are ""ok"" or he doesn't actually know he has difficulties","I wish I could help him raise his score"
"111",111,"Do not give up. Study harder and you will get better results.","I think my child underestimate the difficulty of the subject","I would feel worried"
"112",112,"Whooo....We need to be more prepared for the next time.","54% means she understands we might need to work on concetration.","Feel okay but concerned"
"113",113,"This was your first attempt. We will arrange extra classes for your and be more consistent with practicing maths problems. You got this!","God help me.","Disappointed and worried at the same time."
"114",114,"Son, what happened? Let's check that test.

I would immediately look at the test and see what sections he scored the lowest and notice what they had in common. For example, are they mostly fractions, or divisions? What was the most common mistake and then go over with my child one of the questions and have him solve it with me.","I don't think my kid really understood what was going on. One thing is to believe they studied well, but more than likely I didn't supervise it or check their progress and just let him be on his own. His failure is probably my fault for not getting involved.","Badly, because this is something that could affect my child's self esteem while also proving I was just taking him at his word instead of getting involved in his learning."
"115",115,"This things baby. There’s no need to be ashamed of anything. Failing is not the end of anything, you just need to get back at it and work even harder to improve. I want you to accept the results and go back and work harder for the next test, baby.","I would think that my child is just a little behind in  understanding the subject and needs to work a little more harder to improve.","I would feel a little disappointed for not helping my child do her very best."
"116",116,"This literally just happened to me, only my child failed the entire first marking period. I told them it was okay, I'd seen them working hard on their homework and recognized their efforts and suggested they meet up with their teacher to get any needed help/form a game plan to continue. I also pointed out that things like homework especially (but also tests) are made for you to mess up on, so you can see where you've gone wrong and not understood something (and sometimes, if everyone borks a question, the teacher can see where they've gone wrong)","It's fine, everyone does poorly sometimes. Especially with the world as it currently is, there's a heck ton more stress than I ever had to deal with.","Like I've done my best supporting them, and helping them learn and grow from this."
"117",117,"I would tell her it's okay in life we will fail but that shouldn't stop us from chasing our dreams. And help her where she was wrong.","That she tried here best","Okay"
"118",118,"I would tell my child that everyone fails sometimes, but sometimes it’s best to study harder and try again","That she got confused and doubted herself","i would feel the same as before"
"119",119,"I would suggest that the child should maybe change their approach on the subject. I would also like the child to put in more effort on the school work.","The child took the subject too lightly and that is why he did not do well.","I would feel very disappointed towards his working rate and that he does not take his work that seriously. I would be disappointed s/he does not ask for clarification on what he does not understand."
